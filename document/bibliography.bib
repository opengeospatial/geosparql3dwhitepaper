ABSTRACT = {In 2012, the Open Geospatial Consortium published GeoSPARQL defining “an RDF/OWL ontology for [spatial] information”, “SPARQL extension functions” for performing spatial operations on RDF data and “RIF rules” defining entailments to be drawn from graph pattern matching. In the 8+ years since its publication, GeoSPARQL has become the most important spatial Semantic Web standard, as judged by references to it in other Semantic Web standards and its wide use for Semantic Web data. An update to GeoSPARQL was proposed in 2019 to deliver a version 1.1 with a charter to: handle outstanding change requests and source new ones from the user community and to “better present” the standard, that is to better link all the standard’s parts and better document and exemplify elements. Expected updates included new geometry representations, alignments to other ontologies, handling of new spatial referencing systems, and new artifact presentation. This paper describes motivating change requests and actual resultant updates in the candidate version 1.1 of the standard alongside reference implementations and usage examples. We also describe the theory behind particular updates, initial implementations of many parts of the standard, and our expectations for GeoSPARQL 1.1’s use.},

abstract="IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) is a collection of open web standards, broadly used for presenting and annotating high resolution images and audiovisual content, adopted by hundreds of GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives, museums) organisations worldwide, and permit the reuse and recombination of digital assets across traditional digital institutional boundaries. While these standards have been successful for 2D images and AV (Audio/Video) data, there is a growing interest in how they might be applied to 3D content. An example of this would be to combine shards of pottery from disparate collections into a single whole within a viewing experience. The IIIF 3D Community Group has been collaboratively considering common challenges and potential solutions to key areas, with major 3D developers and researchers, and ongoing dialogue with VIGIE2020/654 study colleagues, forming the IIIF 3D Technical Specification Group, engaging even more widely with other specialists and representatives across user communities and standards bodies.",

Therefore we divided the 3D capturing workflow into common steps starting with the object being placed in front of a 3D scanner to preparation and publication of the 3D datasets and/or derived images. While the proposed ontology is well defined on a coarse level of detail for very different techniques, e.g.~\emph{Stucture from Motion} and \emph{LiDAR} we elaborated the metadata scheme in very fine detail for 3D scanners available at our institutions. This includes practical experiments with measurement data from past and current projects including datasets published at Zenodo as guiding examples and the source code for their computation. Additionally, the free and Open Source GigaMesh Software Framework's analysis and processing methods have been extended to provide metadata about the 3D processing steps like mesh cleaning as well as 2D image generation. Finally, we discuss the current limitations and give an outlook about future extensions.}

abstract="Topologic is a software modelling library that supports a comprehensive conceptual framework for the hierarchical spatial representation of buildings based on the data structures and concepts of non-manifold topology (NMT). Topologic supports conceptual design and spatial reasoning through the integration of geometry, topology, and semantics. This enables architects and designers to reflect on their design decisions before the complexities of building information modelling (BIM) set in. We summarize below related work on NMT starting in the late 1980s, describe Topologic's software architecture, methods, and classes, and discuss how Topologic's features support conceptual design and spatial reasoning. We also report on a software usability workshop that was conducted to validate a software evaluation methodology and reports on the collected qualitative data. A reflection on Topologic's features and software architecture illustrates how it enables a fundamental shift from pursuing fidelity of design form to pursuing fidelity of design intent.",

abstract = {Because of the growing popularity of 3D modelling, there is a great demand for efficient mechanisms to automatically process 3D contents. Owing to the lack of semantics, however, most 3D scenes cannot be interpreted by software agents. 3D ontologies can provide formal definitions for 3D objects; however, many of them are semi-structured only, cover a narrow knowledge domain, do not provide comprehensive coverage for geometric primitives, and do not exploit the full expressivity of the implementation language. This paper presents the most comprehensive formally grounded 3D ontology to date that maps the entire XSD-based vocabulary of the industry standard X3D (ISO/IEC 19775-19777) to OWL 2, complemented by fundamental concepts and roles of the 3D modelling industry not covered by X3D. This upper ontology can be used for the representation, annotation, and efficient indexing of 3D models, and their retrieval by 3D characteristics rather than by associated category labels. }

Consistent annotation of metadata is needed to provide the context necessary to understand, reuse, and integrate these data. This report describes an effort to establish metadata standards for three-dimensional (3D) microscopy datasets for use by the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies® (BRAIN) Initiative and the neuroscience research community. These standards were built on existing efforts and developed with input from the brain microscopy community to promote adoption. The resulting 3D Microscopy Metadata Standards (3D-MMS) includes 91 fields organized into seven categories: Contributors, Funders, Publication, Instrument, Dataset, Specimen, and Image. Adoption of these metadata standards will ensure that investigators receive credit for their work, promote data reuse, facilitate downstream analysis of shared data, and encourage collaboration.},

  abstract     = {CityGML is an important standard to present 3D geometry, topology, semantics and appearance that together with 3D city models, which have had increased use within analysis and applications, such as emergency response, energy consumption and occupancy measurement. However, the standard’s querying and integration capabilities can still be further explored. One way to do this is through the Semantic Web technology knowledge graphs (KG). Proof-of-concept studies have been made using this approach but remains to be properly applied outside of studies as ad-hoc and data conversion approaches are still the most prevalent in practice. The approach can potentially be applied to fields such as the building permit process and transport infrastructure management as means to further help the digitalization in these fields and improve the workflows by allowing seamless linking and integration of other data while being queriable. This study provides a demonstration in how CityGML data can be presented as a virtual knowledge graph (VKG) in an effective manner through the commonly used tools 3DCityDB and Protégé with the Ontop plugin. This provides a means to improve interoperability between different types of data as well as a method to better manage semantical 3D city models. A framework is described in this study to populate the commonly used CityGML 2.0 ontology with CityGML data containing buildings from an area in Malmö, Sweden. This is primarily done through the use of R2RML mapping that retrieves the CityGML data from a 3DCityDB relational database to create virtual instances of data based on the CityGML ontology, thus exposing the data as a VKG through the Ontop system. To ensure that the data is effectively represented and demonstrated, SPARQL queries were performed to validate and test the KG. Seven queries were made in total to test different parts of the KG and to demonstrate some practical implications of the approach. The resulting KG constructed from the mapping retrieves the expected results through the queries, based on comparisons with the original data. As a result, it can be concluded that the CityGML data is effectively represented in the KG. Most notably, the showcasing of the mapping for LoD3 buildings provides a novel description of the implementation process. The framework described is sufficient for the representation despite the limitations imposed by the 3DCityDB database schema and Protégé suite while also demonstrating the potential use of the approach for urban planning processes.},

ABSTRACT = {The accurate assessment of proper value in complex and increasingly high-rise urban environments is a significant challenge. Previous research has identified property value as a composite of indoor elements, such as volume and height, and 3D simulations of the outdoor environment, including variables such as view, noise, and pollution. These simulations have been preliminary performed in taxation context; however, there has been no work addressing the simulation of property valuation. In this paper, we propose an IFC-CityGML data integration approach for property valuation and develop a workflow based on IFC-CityGML 3.0 to simulate and model 3D property variables at the Level of Information Need. We evaluate this approach by testing it for two indoor variables, indoor daylight and property unit cost. Our proposed approach aims to improve the accuracy of property valuation by integrating data from indoor and outdoor environments and providing a standardized and efficient workflow for property valuation modeling using IFC and CityGML. Our approach represents a solid base for future works toward a 3D property valuation extension.},

We comprehensively evaluated, repaired and refined an existing CityGML ontology to produce an improved version that could pass the necessary tests and complete unit test development. A corresponding data transformation tool, originally designed to work alongside CityGML, was extended. This allowed for the transformation of original data into a form of semantic triples. We compared various scalable technologies for this semantic data storage and chose Blazegraph™ as it provided the required geospatial search functionality. We also evaluated scalable hardware data solutions and file systems using the publicly available CityGML 2.0 data of Charlottenburg in Berlin, Germany as a working example. The structural isomorphism of the CityGML schemas and the OntoCityGML Tbox allowed the data to be transformed without loss of information. Efficient geospatial search algorithms allowed us to retrieve building data from any point in a city using coordinates. The use of named graphs and namespaces for data partitioning ensured the system performance stayed well below its capacity limits. This was achieved by evaluating scalable and dedicated data storage hardware capable of hosting expansible file systems, which strengthened the architectural foundations of the target system.}

abstract = {Abstract An indispensable element of any practical 3D/VR/AR application is synthetic three-dimensional (3D) content. Such content is characterized by a variety of features—geometry, structure, space, appearance, animation and behaviour—which makes the modelling of 3D content a much more complex, difficult and time-consuming task than in the case of other types of content. One of the promising research directions aiming at simplification of modelling 3D content is the use of the semantic web approach. The formalism provided by semantic web techniques enables declarative knowledge-based modelling of content based on ontologies. Such modelling can be conducted at different levels of abstraction, possibly domain-specific, with inherent separation of concerns. The use of semantic web ontologies enables content representation independent of particular presentation platforms and facilitates indexing, searching and analysing content, thus contributing to increased content re-usability. A range of approaches have been proposed to permit semantic representation and modelling of synthetic 3D content. These approaches differ in the methodologies and technologies used as well as their scope and application domains. This paper provides a review of the current state of the art in representation and modelling of 3D content based on semantic web ontologies, together with a classification, characterization and discussion of the particular approaches.},

  abstract={The pervasive smart manufacturing is bringing increasing attention to digital twin. As a core part of virtual modeling, 3D virtual modeling is crucial to improve the intuitiveness of state monitoring, enhance human-cyber interactions, visualize conditions and simulations, and provide visual guides in digital twin. However, although 3D virtual modeling in digital twin has many benefits for different applications, its complex characteristics become obstacles for novice engineers to develop and utilize. Besides, research information about 3D virtual modeling in digital twin is too scattered, while there has been no literature review that specially and comprehensively summarizes and analyzes it. To help novice engineers understand and scheme 3D virtual modeling in digital twin for future research and applications, this paper reviews 106 digital twin 3D modeling cases with their characteristics, including deployment targets, purposes \& roles, collaborative models, data flows, the autonomy of 3D modeling, fidelity, twinning rates, enabling technologies, and enabling tools. This paper then discusses and analyzes the review outcomes via statistics. Finally, this paper also proposes a thinking map for scheming the 3D virtual modeling in digital twin. In general, 3D virtual modeling is oriented by the motivation behind different digital twins, engineers hence should reflect on the purposes, scenarios, resources, and long-term visions of their projects. When designing characteristics of 3D virtual modeling, engineers must consider functions, capabilities of data processing and transmission, timeliness of data, applicability, and specialty of each characteristic. For future work, this paper highlights three important research issues to realize the prospect of 3D virtual modeling, including the versatility of autonomous 3D modeling, incremental updates of 3D models, and optimal planning of data collections for 3D modeling. Besides, future work will also investigate the enhancem},
