== Motivation

=== Why do we want 3D semantic modeling?
 The white paper: "OGC Benefits of Representing Spatial Data Using Semantic and Graph Technologies" describes the beneficiaries and benefits of representing data, including geospatial data, using semantic and graph technologies <<Abhayaratna2020wp>>. This section describes the motivation of adding 3D functionality to the GeoSPARQL standard. 

 While humans can often resolve spatial questions such as “Is cube A inside cylinder B?” — even when the underlying data comes from different systems like GIS and BIM — this typically relies on implicit understanding, conventions, or direct communication between the data creators. For datasets to be meaningfully aligned, the people who created them often need to clarify assumptions, data structures, coordinate systems, or modeling intentions. Without such human-to-human explanation, machines struggle to interpret spatial relationships across heterogeneous sources. When using machines to analyze geometries and spatial relationships in heterogeneous datasets, a conversion process is required. Data is made homogeneous for analysis through extraction, transformation, and loading. Based on a homogeneous dataset, conclusions can then be drawn. Performing conversions may result in geometric simplifications, which can limit or even eliminate the functionality of spatial queries <<Biljecki2019>>.
 If one desires digital, automated processing or analysis of 3D spatial questions, spatial information must be structured in an explicitly machine-readable format. When this is done, initiatives based on federated systems with heterogeneous datasets can obtain computer-generated answers to spatial 3D queries without requiring conversion. This highlights the importance of semantic alignment and standardized geometry processing in machine-driven analysis. <<Göbel2024>>

 When performing federated queries on heterogeneous spatial datasets without conversion, a common vocabulary is required to semantically define the 3D object and its 3D spatial function. For both humans and machines, it must be unambiguous what is meant by a query such as:

 “Does the '3D geometry' of the proposed construction '3D-intersect' with the '3D geometry'of an existing asset owned by another party?”

 It should not matter whether the data is provided in a 3D-GIS, 3D-BIM or 3D-CG standard vocabulary.  

=== Added value of 3D in the GeoSPARQL Vocabulary for Stakeholders
==== We aim to support data Consumers by:
 - access and understanding of 3D-geometry and 3D-topology from multiple sources; 
 - the integration of 3D-data geospatial and non-geospatial;
 - data quality evaluation of the given 3D-data;
 - Geometric and topological description in natural language.

==== We aim to support Data Providers by:
 - Maximize the use of 3D-geometry and 3D-topology data;
 - Defining multiple 3D topology or geometries;
 - To quality-assure 3D geospatial data.


=== Semantic-functional value of 3D-GeoSPARQL
 Value for data reasoning, formal description, and semantic interoperability
==== Meaningful creation and querying of 3D geometry
 Whether manually or programmatically defining 3D geometries in BIM, GEO or CG environments, the GeoSPARQL standard could provide or connect to vocabulary to represent 3D structures. A 3D cube, for example, can be represented in multiple ways:

 - As a set of bounding points, lines, and faces;
 - As a base surface with an extrude function;
 - As an 3D geometric primitive (e.g., the concept of a 'cube' as a spatial figure).

 When GeoSPARQL offers the means to define and link 3D geometries in these different ways, it allows both humans and machines to interpret and interact with the data effectively.

==== Meaningful creation and querying of 3D topological relationships
 Is “3D Geometry A” inside, touching, overlapping, intersecting or above “3D Geometry B”?

 Being able to describe and use such topological relationships is crucial for conducting spatial analyses, formulating rules, and deriving knowledge from differten heterogeneous datasets.

 Beyond describing topological relationships, one should be able to query them:

 What is the spatial relationship between 3D Geometry A and 3D Geometry B?

 Such queries should return the appropriate topological result (e.g., "intersects"), which is essential for use cases like clash detection in design validation
==== Derivation of geometric and topological knowledge
 From explicitly modeled geometric and topological data, one should be able to infer implicit knowledge.

 For instance, if 3D Geometry A is 3D inside 3D Geometry B, then we can infer that:

 A does not "touch" B, and
 A does not "overlap" with B,

 even if these facts are not explicitly stated.

 For entailment we aim to be able to answer queries like: "Does this tree have a 3D geometry?"

 If the tree is defined using a MultiSolid geometry, then the answer should be "yes," even if this is not explicitly declared as such.

==== Adding multiple 2D and 3D geometries to a single feature
 GeoSPARQL supports linking multiple geometries (e.g., 2D and 2.5D) to a single feature. We aim to extend this with 3D geometries. 

 For example, a tree in the real world may be represented in databases with both a 2D and a 3D geometry.

 This should not require duplication of the tree entity — there can be one tree instance with both geometries linked, avoiding redundancy in the data model.

=== Value for user experience, visualization, and application use of 3D-GeoSPARQL
==== Visualization
 There is a growing need to visualize how 3D data in BIM and GIS relate to one another. Stakeholders want to see BIM and/or 3D Geo data of a newly planned structure visualized within the 3D Geo and/or BIM context of the existing digital city. A shared vocabulary that can present both domains in an integrated way supports this goal.
==== Calculation and analysis
 semantic modelled 3D-model enables powerful computation and analysis. Analytical results can be displayed in dashboards operating within the GeoBIM domain. This creates a bridge between asset management (typically GIS-oriented) and project management (typically BIM-oriented), allowing for cross-domain collaboration and decision-making.
==== Spatial querying
 Spatial querying is a key function within a federated GeoBIM Network. Questions such as "What material is located in this area?" or "Where is space available for new cables and pipelines?" are examples of 3D spatial queries that can be answered when GeoSPARQL 3D is functioning effectively across systems and semantics.
==== Machine control
 A shared semantic GeoBIM Network also supports machine control. The GIS domain typically describes the existing situation, while the BIM domain describes the intended or future situation. This combination can be used to automatically instruct and guide machines in the built environment.
==== Modeling, simulation and planning
 A network of datasets with 3D-data should support the modeling, simulation and planning of future changes to the built environment. Users — whether human or machine — can use the network and GeoSPARQL 3D to propose and model modifications in either BIM or GIS formats. A well-functioning 3D semantic GeoBIM Network enables this kind of forward-looking spatial planning and design.

=== Added value of the Vocabulary for Organisations
==== Brings together different domains (GIS, BIM, CG)
 GeoSPARQL 3D can help in bringing together different domains that work with 3D information. 
==== Enables extension to vocabularies from other domains
 The vocabulary can have the possiblity to extend to vocabulaires with 3D geometry or topology from other domain, for example the Building Ontology Topology (BOT), RELOC Ontology or GEOM ontology
==== Facilitates better interoperability between knowledge domains with spatial components (geography, aerospace, architecture, product design, (bio)chemistry, IoT, …)
A unified geometric language can help by migrating ideas and methods across fields, accelerating innovation. For example a parametic design algoritm, rule, or llm making use of geometry and topology originated in aerospace, can be re-used in the architecture domain.
